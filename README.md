# Belly Button Biodiversity w/ Plotly

## Overview

     Does thinking about belly buttons and bacteria make you hungry?  Great!  The Improbable Beef compnay is looking for bacteria species that have the ability to synthesize proteins which taste like beef.  So far, labs have been able to synthesize meat from algea, fungi, and plant root microorganisms.  However, so far, those results have left tasters asking, "Where's the beef (flavor)?"  Improbably Beef is hoping that crazy amounts of lint won't be the only thing found in belly buttons; they believe that the elusive beef-flavored bacterial species may be residing in there as well.
	As a result, they have gone navel gazing across the world, checking nout belly buttons of countless volunteers to see if anyone happens to have beefy belly button bacteria.  In order to assist on their quest, we aim to create a website which takes information from those studies and displays it in various easy-to-read tables and charts.  When the user selects the Test Subject ID from the dropdown menu, they will be provided with a table full of demographic information, both a horizontal bar chart and a bubble chart showing what bacteria they have, and a gauge chart showing how often they (claim to) wash their belly button.
